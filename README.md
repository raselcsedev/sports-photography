# Preview Sports Photography React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Preview Sports Photography](https://preview-sports-photography.web.app/).


##Features of Preview Sports Photography - 
* For focussing on fast-moving subjects, the al-servo mode is required. However, for sports that require a variety of shots, the ability to hold many lenses is a huge plus.
* Fast zoom lens - Apart from the fact that the distance between the action and the photographer constantly changes, venue lighting can also sometimes be very poor. As such, I always suggest the use of a fast zoom lens for the versatility and the ability to shoot in low light, while still retaining decent shutter speeds.
* A crop sensor - As a start, I would always recommend the 70-200mm f2.8. This lens is light, available across all major lens makers and is relatively inexpensive.
* The checkout page gives customers the opportunity to enter payment details and complete their order.
